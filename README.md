## üé™ The Clown Candidate Approach

This system is designed for an unconventional campaign that combines:
- **Performance Art**: Can collection with campaign materials (clown nose classification example)
- **Authentic Rural Messaging**: AI agents understand NY-24's agricultural community
- **Small-Dollar Fundraising**: QR codes + voter information capture at events
- **FEC Compliance**: Automated compliance for creative campaign activities

### Example: Clown Nose Expense Classification
The system automatically categorizes a "$50 clown nose from France" as:
- **Classification**: `pending` (60% confidence)
- **Reason**: "Could be art project or campaign prop - requires manual review"
- **Category**: `art_project` ‚Üí `creative_materials`

This allows manual reclassification based on actual usage (personal art vs campaign events).
