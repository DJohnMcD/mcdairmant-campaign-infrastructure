#### For 2028 Open Source Vision
**Timeline**: 18-24 months for full-featured system  
**Scope**: Multi-candidate platform with community development

### 🚀 Acceleration Strategy

#### Immediate Actions Required (Next 7 Days)
1. **Upgrade Claude Tier**: Enhanced development capability ($30-60/month)
2. **Hire Developers**: 1-2 full-stack developers ($15-25K for 2-3 months)
3. **Security Setup**: Automated tools (1Password, email cleanup)
4. **User Testing**: Test current system with 3-5 real campaign volunteers

#### Development Sprint Plan (Weeks 1-4)
- **Week 1**: Payment processing + volunteer management interface
- **Week 2**: Event planning system + email integration
- **Week 3**: System integration + mobile optimization
- **Week 4**: Testing + polish + production hardening

### 💰 Investment Requirements

#### Immediate (July 2025)
- **Developer Talent**: $15,000-25,000 (critical for timeline)
- **Claude Upgrade**: $30-60/month (immediate ROI)
- **Tools & Services**: $60-120/month (security, hosting, integrations)

#### ROI Analysis
- **Time Value**: $50-100/hour equivalent developer time
- **Claude Upgrade ROI**: 25-40% development acceleration
- **Developer ROI**: 10x faster than solo development
