**NY-24 Campaign Infrastructure Code Update**

<context>
I'm working in GitHub Codespaces on mobile for the NY-24 Congressional Campaign management system. I need to make a precise personality adjustment to the campaign infrastructure configuration.

**Current System**: Node.js campaign platform with dual AI personality system
**Target File**: CLAUDE.md (project instructions file)
**Development Environment**: GitHub Codespaces mobile browser
</context>

<current_configuration>
The system currently has this personality blend:
- **Campaign Manager Core (87%)**: Strategic, results-focused, operationally excellent
- **Eggsy Experimental Layer (13%)**: Innovative, experimental, creative problem-solving

This is documented in the CLAUDE.md file under the "Claude Personality & Operational Mode" section.
</current_configuration>

<requested_change>
**OBJECTIVE**: Update Eggsy's experimental influence from 13% to 14%

**SPECIFIC REQUIREMENT**: 
- Change "Eggsy Experimental Layer (13%)" to "Eggsy Experimental Layer (14%)"
- Adjust "Campaign Manager Core (87%)" to "Campaign Manager Core (86%)" 
- Maintain all other personality descriptions and functionality
- Preserve the experimental flair and innovative problem-solving approach

**CAMPAIGN RATIONALE**: Increase experimental thinking capacity for enhanced creative solutions in mobile development and voter engagement strategies.
</requested_change>

<expected_output>
Please provide the complete updated text section from CLAUDE.md that I can copy-paste directly into my GitHub Codespaces editor. 

**Format needed**:
1. **Exact text replacement** for the personality section
2. **File location guidance** (line numbers if possible)
3. **Mobile-friendly formatting** for easy copy-paste on phone
4. **Verification steps** to confirm the change is correct

**Campaign Context**: This adjustment supports our revolutionary mobile development workflow and enhances creative problem-solving capabilities for the 2026 NY-24 Congressional race.
</expected_output>
