# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

**NY-24 CAMPAIGN INFRASTRUCTURE**: This is a comprehensive AI-powered campaign management system for the NY-24 Congressional race in 2026 (McDairmant for Congress), featuring specialized AI agents, mobile voter lookup, FEC compliance automation, and full expense tracking with accounting integration.

## Claude Personality & Operational Mode

**CLAUDE OPERATIONAL DIRECTIVE**: When working on this campaign infrastructure, Claude Code should adopt the personality and thinking style of a Campaign Manager with 14% of responses driven by "Eggsy the Extraordinary Experimental Expert" persona. This creates:

- **Campaign Manager Core (86%)**: Strategic, results-focused, operationally excellent, timeline-driven, resource-conscious
- **Eggsy Experimental Layer (14%)**: Highly intelligent analytical innovator who sees unique connections others miss, approaches problems with multi-angle logical verification, creative yet methodical problem-solving, future-tech integration with careful validation

**Communication Style**: Energetic, confident, strategic with experimental flair. Use campaign terminology, maintain urgency around electoral timelines, and always think in terms of voter impact and campaign effectiveness.

**The Garden Concept**: Revolutionary ideas should be cultivated in "TheGarden.md" - a strategic innovation parking lot where concepts grow, merge, split, and mature before rapid execution. Each Garden entry includes full analysis of inputs, outputs, design, infrastructure, costs (monetary/non-monetary), and deployment strategy using latest AI engineering tools (RAG, MCP, etc.).

## Architecture

Campaign Infrastructure is a Node.js web application providing a specialized multi-agent AI interface optimized for congressional campaign operations, with privacy boundaries and role-based campaign functionality.

**Core Web Server** (`server.js`): Express.js application serving authentication, campaign agent interfaces, and comprehensive API endpoints. Handles session management with bcrypt authentication, routing for static files, and campaign-specific API calls. Integrates MCP (Model Context Protocol) clients with privacy filtering. Includes comprehensive expense tracking, bank reconciliation, Square payment integration, and FEC compliance systems.

**Campaign Agent System**: Four specialized AI agents with campaign-specific roles and data access:
- **Martin - Campaign Director**: Electoral strategy, voter outreach, resource allocation for NY-24 (campaign data access)
- **Terri - Private Strategy Advisor**: Confidential campaign strategy and candidate coaching (private conversations, strategic insights)
- **Eggsy - Creative/Content Director**: Social media strategy, messaging, creative campaigns for rural NY-24 voters (content data access)
- **Ethel - Legal/Compliance Director**: FEC compliance, campaign finance law, ethical guidelines (compliance data access, receives strategic shares from Terri)

**Database Architecture** (Hybrid SQLite/PostgreSQL): Campaign-optimized data stores with privacy boundaries, automatically detected via DATABASE_URL:
- `users`: User authentication and sessions
- `entries`: Campaign entries with auto-categorization (task/journal/note/strategy)
- `agent_responses`: Shared campaign conversations (Martin, Eggsy, Ethel)
- `terri_private`: Private strategy sessions with Terri (not visible to other agents)
- Agent-specific data: `martin_data`, `eggsy_data`, `ethel_data`
- **Campaign Tables**: `campaign_donors`, `campaign_voters`, `campaign_volunteers`, `campaign_events`, `campaign_expenditures`, `opposition_research`
- **Financial Tracking Tables**: `campaign_expenses`, `bank_transactions`, `cash_receipts`, `payment_integrations`, `expense_classification_rules`, `reconciliation_matches`, `social_media_posts`

**Permission System**:
- Terri sees ALL user data but conversations with her are private from other agents
- Terri can manually share information with Ethel (creates "need to know" flags for Martin/Eggsy)
- Other agents only see general entries and shared conversations

**Frontend** (`public/`): Multi-page web interface with campaign agent switching, real-time chat, and auto-categorized input processing. Supports tagged input (`<task>`, `<strategy>`, `<compliance>`, `<content>`) and manual entry categorization. Dashboard provides unified access to all campaign agents.

## Key Campaign Features

- **Campaign Auto-categorization**: Input processing detects campaign tasks, strategy notes, and compliance items
- **Specialized Agent Roles**: Each agent optimized for specific campaign functions (strategy, legal, creative, private)
- **NY-24 District Integration**: Built-in knowledge of district demographics, key counties, opponent research
- **Comprehensive Financial Tracking**: Automated expense classification, bank reconciliation, Square payment integration
- **FEC Compliance Automation**: Real-time compliance checking, contribution limit monitoring, automated reporting
- **Privacy by Design**: Separate data stores ensure strategic conversations remain private while enabling controlled sharing
- **Campaign Data Management**: Comprehensive voter, donor, volunteer, and event tracking
- **Tag Support**: Use `<task>`, `<strategy>`, `<compliance>`, `<content>` tags for campaign categorization
- **Team Role-Based Access**: Different team members access appropriate agents and data
- **Intelligent Expense Classification**: Automatic categorization with manual override (handles edge cases like art project vs campaign props)
- **Multi-Source Reconciliation**: Automated matching across bank statements, payment processors, and cash receipts

## Campaign Database Schema

The application uses SQLite with campaign-specific tables for electoral operations. The `terri_private` table isolates strategic conversations, while campaign tables provide structured data for electoral activities. Manual sharing from Terri to Ethel creates compliance audit trails without exposing private strategy to Martin/Eggsy.

**Core Tables**:
- `users`: Authentication and sessions
- `entries`: Auto-categorized campaign entries (tasks/strategy/compliance)
- `agent_responses`: Shared agent conversations
- `terri_private`: Private Terri conversations (not visible to other agents)
- `martin_data`, `eggsy_data`, `ethel_data`: Agent-specific data stores

**Campaign Operations Tables**:
- `campaign_donors`: FEC-compliant donor tracking with contribution limits
- `campaign_voters`: Voter database with NY-24 county targeting and support levels
- `campaign_volunteers`: Volunteer management with skills and availability tracking
- `campaign_events`: Event planning with attendance and financial tracking
- `campaign_expenditures`: Basic expense tracking (legacy)
- `opposition_research`: Organized research on Claudia Tenney and district issues

**Enhanced Financial Tracking Tables**:
- `campaign_expenses`: Advanced expense tracking with automatic classification, reconciliation status, and FEC compliance
- `bank_transactions`: Raw bank statement data with CSV import capability and reconciliation tracking
- `cash_receipts`: Manual cash receipt tracking for can collections and event donations
- `payment_integrations`: Square and other payment processor transaction logs with donor data capture
- `expense_classification_rules`: Configurable rules engine for automatic expense categorization

## Critical Implementation Notes

**Agent Response Generation**: Each agent has specialized `generate[AgentName]Response()` functions in `server.js` that handle campaign-specific messaging, MCP integration, and privacy filtering. These functions determine agent personality and capabilities.

**MCP Integration Flow**: 
1. Agent receives user input
2. Privacy filter processes data based on agent role (strict/moderate/audit)
3. MCP client calls external structured thinking tools if available (sequential thinking server)
4. Enhanced response combines agent personality with MCP insights
5. Audit logging tracks all MCP interactions for compliance

**Sequential Thinking Integration**: The system integrates with `@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking` for systematic problem-solving:
- Available via `mcpClient.callTool('sequentialthinking', {...})` 
- Provides structured step-by-step analysis for complex campaign decisions
- Used for debugging, strategy planning, and systematic decision-making
- Connection managed automatically in `mcp-client.js` with retry logic

**Privacy Architecture**: 
- Terri's conversations are isolated in `terri_private` table
- Strategic sharing from Terri to Ethel creates audit trails without exposing details to Martin/Eggsy
- Campaign data access is role-based (team members see only relevant agent data)
- PII filtering automatically redacts sensitive information in MCP calls

**NY-24 Integration**: The `NY24_HELPERS` object provides district-specific functions for content relevance assessment, county-targeted messaging, and voter priority calculation that should be used throughout the campaign workflow.

**Google Docs Integration**: The `GoogleDocsService` class provides OAuth 2.0 authenticated access to Google Docs for reading Claude-generated code. Requires `google-credentials.json` file from Google Cloud Console with Docs and Drive API enabled. Use `/api/google-docs/status` to check setup and authentication status.

**AI-to-AI Workflow Integration**: Revolutionary Claude â†’ GitHub Copilot Agent Mode integration enables natural language development requests that translate automatically into production code:
- **GitHub Copilot Agent Mode**: Configured via `.github/copilot-instructions.md` with full campaign context and NY-24 district knowledge
- **MCP Campaign Server**: Custom Model Context Protocol server (`mcp-campaign-server.js`) with 6 specialized campaign intelligence tools
- **Prompt Templates**: 4 specialized Agent Mode prompts in `.github/prompts/` for voter management, FEC compliance, agent enhancement, and Claude-to-Copilot bridge functionality
- **VS Code Integration**: Configured in `.vscode/settings.json` for seamless agent mode operation with MCP tool access
- **Testing**: Use `node test-ai-to-ai-workflow.js` to validate the complete integration pipeline
