# Campaign Infrastructure Security Implementation

## üîí Security Features Implemented

### **Invitation-Only Registration**
- Only pre-approved email addresses can register
- Current approved emails: john@mcdairmant.com, djohnmcd@gmail.com, campaign staff
- Add new team members to `APPROVED_EMAILS` array in server.js

### **Rate Limiting Protection**
- **General API**: 100 requests per 15 minutes per IP
- **Authentication**: 5 login attempts per 15 minutes per IP  
- **File Uploads**: 10 uploads per hour per IP
- Protects against brute force and DDoS attacks

### **Enhanced Password Security**
- Minimum 8 character passwords required
- bcrypt with 12 rounds (increased from default 10)
- Password strength validation

### **Security Headers (Helmet.js)**
- Content Security Policy
- XSS Protection
- MIME type sniffing prevention
- Clickjacking protection

### **Audit Logging**
- All user registrations logged
- File upload attempts tracked
- IP address and user agent recorded
- Searchable audit trail for compliance

### **Database Security**
- Email column added to users table
- Audit log table for security events
- Foreign key constraints maintained

## üöÄ Deployment Security

### **Environment Variables Required**
```bash
# Basic Configuration
NODE_ENV=production
SESSION_SECRET=your-32-character-random-secret
PORT=8080

# Campaign Information
CAMPAIGN_NAME=McDairmant for Congress
CAMPAIGN_DISTRICT=NY-24

# Optional API Keys
NEWS_API_KEY=your-newsapi-key
SQUARE_APPLICATION_ID=your-square-app-id
```

### **Team Member Management**
To add new team members, update the `APPROVED_EMAILS` array in server.js:
```javascript
const APPROVED_EMAILS = [
  'john@mcdairmant.com',
  'djohnmcd@gmail.com',
  'newstaff@email.com',  // Add new emails here
];
```

### **Security Monitoring**
- Check audit logs regularly: `SELECT * FROM audit_log ORDER BY timestamp DESC`
- Monitor failed login attempts
- Review file upload activity
- Track unusual IP address patterns

## üõ°Ô∏è Production Recommendations

### **Before Campaign Launch**
1. **Professional Security Audit** - Have a security expert review the system
2. **Penetration Testing** - Test for vulnerabilities
3. **Backup Strategy** - Implement automated daily backups
4. **SSL Certificate** - Ensure HTTPS is properly configured
5. **Database Encryption** - Consider encrypting sensitive fields

### **Ongoing Security**
1. **Regular Updates** - Keep all dependencies current
2. **Log Monitoring** - Review audit logs weekly
3. **Access Review** - Quarterly review of approved users
4. **Incident Response Plan** - Have a plan for security breaches

## üéØ Current Security Level

**GOOD for Testing & Development**
- ‚úÖ Protected against common attacks
- ‚úÖ Invitation-only access
- ‚úÖ Rate limiting and audit logging
- ‚úÖ Secure file uploads

**Recommended for Full Campaign**
- Add 2FA for admin accounts
- Implement session timeouts
- Add real-time threat monitoring
- Professional security audit

This implementation provides solid security for testing and early campaign operations while maintaining the flexibility to enhance security as the campaign grows.
